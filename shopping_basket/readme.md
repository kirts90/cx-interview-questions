## Documentation

As the maintenance of the Catalogue and Offers is being used and updated by different teams 
(as per the requirements of the assignment), each class is designed to be used separately. 
This includes the Basket class as well.

The usage is best explained by the unit tests and the main.py which illustrates and reproduces
the examples in the assignment.md file with exactly the same results.

## How to run

python3 main.py

## How to run the unit tests
In order to execute the unit tests specifically, pass the parameter "-t" or "--test". By default it's false.

For example:

python3 main.py --test

python3 main.py -t

## Dependencies
math, unittest, argparse
